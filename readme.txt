A plugin for adding a social media button to dribbble content.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you shortcode that you can use to show a link to a dribbble shot, as well as the like count and (if you are authenticated with dribbble) whether or not you already like the shot.

`[scribbble shot="12345"]`

A few notes about the sections above:

*	Requires jQuery 2.*+
*   The link will show up similar to a social media button.
*   The like count will show up next to the button/link.
*   To see if you already like a shot, you must first have logged into dribbble.
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that we've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one we've verified.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
